whoText: "This is a shuttle access downhill trail that is suitable for all ages and multiple different bike styles- although best suited for all mountain, dirtjumper or full on DH bikes. At the bottom the trail joins Hide and Seek above a major creek crossing. Built specifically for mountain bikes, a flow trail emphasizes speed and rhythm, featuring berms, rollers, jumps and other features that are designed in a way that uses the riderâ€™s momentum to minimize pedaling and braking (think downhill pump track). Very loose and dry. Watch that you don't overshoot the switchback to stay on the black diamond descent - the blue route is completely overgrown."
